/// The most precise way to perform ODE event detection is to use a root solver to find where the

/// ODE state, `y`, this requires a large amount of intermediate propagations (using some
/// [`crate::Integrator`]), which in turn results in many additional evaluations of the ODE
/// `dy/dt = f(t,y)`. In large-scale practical applications (i.e. not toy problems), the evaluation
/// of `f(t,y)` is typically the most costly operation.
///
/// The purpose of the condition function is to only try to detect an event when the current time
/// and/or state satisfies some condition. For example, if we know some event will only feasibly
/// occur after time `t = 20`, it makes no sense to try to perform a costly event detection at times

///
/// # Overview
///
/// An event is a condition that is monitored during numerical integration of an ODE. When the
/// condition is met, the ODE solver detects it and takes appropriate action. Events are commonly
/// used for handling discontinuities, stopping conditions, or state-dependent modifications of the
/// ODE being solved.
///
/// # Defining Events
///
/// At the core of an event is the event function, `g(t,y)`. The event corresponding to an event
/// function occurs when the event function evaluates to 0 (i.e. an event is the root/zero of an
/// event function). See [`EventFunction`] for more details.
///
/// In addition to storing an event function `g(t,y)` (something common to most ODE solvers), the
/// [`Event`] struct also supports two additional types of functions that aim to improve efficiency
/// while also making it easier to express more nuanced problems:
///
/// * [`ConditionFunction`] - Defines when the solver should even bother checking for the existence
///   of an event.
/// * [`StateResetFunction`] - Can be used to reset the value of the ODE state at the occurence of
///   an event.
///
/// There are also many options for controlling the behavior of the ODE solver at an event:
///
/// * [`Direction`] - Defines whether the event function must be decreasing or increasing (or
///   either) for a root of the event function to be considered an event.
/// * [`Termination`] - Defines how many times this event must be detected to terminate an ODE
///   solver.
/// * [`EventDetectionMethod`] - Event detection method, see [`EventDetectionMethod`]  for more
///   details.
///
/// To actually define an event, you can use the [`Event::new`] method. There are dedicated methods
/// for setting additional options, such as a condition function ([`Event::c`]), a state reset
/// function ([`Event::s`]), the event detection method ([`Event::method`]), the direction of the
/// event function ([`Event::direction`]), the termination condition ([`Event::termination`]), and
/// the name of the event ([`Event::name`]).
